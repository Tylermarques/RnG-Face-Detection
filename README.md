 # Resident and Guest detection

This is one I have been dreaming about for a while. A program that detects when someone comes to my house, and can alert me as
to who that is. My end goal is that this system will just be one of many that will feed a bigger system for predictions,
but this is a good place to start.

## SONY SNC-RZ25N
So I've had two of these cameras sitting in my basement for a while. I chose this model because I already
owned two of them; they are far from the best choice, but they are 'free' :shrug:. These particular cameras are PTZ (Pan-Tilt-Zoom) cameras,
meaning they have motors that allow you to position the camera remotely. Pretty cool in and of itself, but more cool when you 
throw in some facial recognition and give the software the ability to move itself.
